# guessGame
Given an upper and lower limit the user will be prompted to input a number. The user will have either seven chances in the harder version or ten chances in the easier version to guess the randomly generated number. In the "easier" version pf guessGame the user will try to guess a number between one and fifty, for every incorrect guess the code will respond with either "Too high..." or "Too low...", until the user has either correctly guessed or used the maximum number of guesses. In the "harder" version of guessGame the user will try to guess a number between zero and one thousand. For every incorrect guess the code will respond with "Generated number is less than entered number, try your luck again..." or "Generated number is greater than entered number, try your luck again..."  until the user has either guessed correctly or used up the available number of attempts.
